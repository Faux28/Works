# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

## Steps to create cdk stack to export rds snapshot to s3

1.Create a new directory.  

 ```
 mkdir rds-snapshot-export-to-s3-pipeline-Python
 ```
    
2.Go to the created directory.  

 ```
 cd rds-snapshot-export-to-s3-pipeline-Python
 ```

3.configure the AWS account.  

 ```
 aws configure
 ```

4.create and activate the virtual environment(windows).  

 ```
 python -m venv .venv
 ```  
 ```
 .venv/bin/activate
 ```

5.install the required dependencies.

 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

6.create a cdk project in python.  

 ```
 cdk init app --language python
 ```

7.create a lambda directory.  

 ```
 mkdir lambda
 ```

8.copy and paste the code in appropriate files.  

9.bootstrap your aws account.  

 ```
 cdk bootstrap
 ```

9.synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.  

 ```
 cdk synth
 ```

10.deploy the stack in aws.  

 ```
 cdk deploy
 ```


## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation


## To Test the code use event.json
 
 * enter the snapshot name.
 * configure the test event in aws console.
 * test the code.


## Glue Crawler 

 * Crawler should be run manually by user when required.  
 it is a paid service.
